title: Lyrics-based Playlist Generation
layout: index
---
Quite often I'd find myself listening to new music and not enjoying the melody too much, but then it 
just takes one or two lyrics to change my opinion about the whole song. After two years of using
Spotify exclusively and frequently, its weekly recommendation playlists on Mondays (_Discover Weekly_)
began to become really good; gifting me 4-5 songs each week. It caught on to the vibe of the
music I liked and also kept up with how my taste evolved.

However, I wondered whether Spotify's recommendation engine factored in lyrical content of the 
songs I liked, or whether it was possible that my 'taste' in lyrics even had detectable 
patterns. This was pretty much impossible to infer from the Discover Weekly playlist directly, nor
was there much help online, so I decided to investigate myself.

### Problem Statement
At the time I started, I had around **1000 songs** that were 'liked' in my library, giving me a good
sample to represent my taste in music. As the earliest songs were saved since early 2017, this
was a relatively recent and dense representation.

> Is it possible to predict whether I like a song based *purely* on its lyrics?

// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
subtracter(3,6);
// > 8
